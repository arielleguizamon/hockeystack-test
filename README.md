## Improvements / Trade offs

To further improve the project, I would consider implementing backend-side pagination if the dataset grows significantly, ensuring the table remains performant. Additionally, the project could benefit from more detailed and customized styling to better align with the brand or user preferences. A trade-off made to meet the deadline was keeping the “library table” styling minimal and functional, focusing on core functionality rather than extensive design customization. With more time, enhancing the visual aspects and optimizing for larger datasets would be key areas of improvement.
